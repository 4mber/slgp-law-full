                <h6>Paralegal</h6><br>
                <p class="text-justify">Shannon Burns, paralegal, has worked in the legal business for over ten years. Shannon works closely with the attorneys at Sarah Lee Gossett Parrish PLLC to provide exceptional legal services to firm clients. She also serves as office administrator and assists in the development and implementation of protocols that maximize efficiency and client satisfaction.<br><br>

                In 2011, Shannon graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a bachelor’s degree in multidisciplinary studies, with areas of focus including civil engineering and web design and development. She received several academic scholarships and was offered research internships with two of OU’s engineering professors. Under the direction of these professors, Shannon drafted a summary and analysis of findings from ODOT (Oklahoma Department of Transportation) concerning the deteriorating structural integrity of bridges and highway overpasses in Oklahoma, and utilized a cutting-edge computer program to model and predict the effect of soil composition on structural displacement during seismic activity. Shannon’s educational background and experience provide her with a unique perspective that is invaluable to the firm and its clients.<br><br>

                Originally from Southern California, Shannon grew up spending summers on the beaches of Orange County, roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over raging bonfires. Regrettably, she never learned how to surf, but she still visits home whenever she can to spend time with family and friends, and to work on her currently nonexistent tan.</p>
