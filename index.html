            <h2 class="featurette-heading">I am a third generation attorney, <span class="text-muted">third generation graduate of the University of Oklahoma Law School,</span></h2>
            <p class="lead"><br>and have been in practice almost 32 years. My grandfather was a criminal defense lawyer and state legislator from Durant, and my daddy was one of the very first federal administrative law judges appointed to the bench in Fort Worth, Texas. Daddy later served as Chief Judge in Oklahoma City, and completed his career with a fifteen year stint in Austin, Texas, where he lived next door to Mac Brown, UT’s football coach. What irony, given that Daddy was a true Sooner born and bred, who seldom missed an OU football game until the year prior to his passing. There is a courtroom dedicated to Daddy in the Austin, Texas federal courthouse.

            <br><br>So, as you can see, my Oklahoma and Texas roots run deep, and I am licensed to practice in both states. If you are looking for an experienced, dedicated lawyer to represent your interests in Oklahoma or Texas, I would be happy to assist you. <br><br>I have earned the highest rating for an attorney, Martindale-Hubbell’s AV rating (ability and ethics) both for peer review and judicial review. While some matters are best served by an hourly billing rate, I have found that it is preferable to quote my clients a flat fee or a contingent one for their projects, and I stick to it. That way there are no surprises for anyone when it comes to costs and fees. There is nothing worse (well, maybe an unfavorable court opinion or jury verdict) than receiving correspondence from your lawyer only to see an unexpected, astronomical number after the $ sign. This does not happen to my clients.

            <br><br>As a former law clerk to a federal trial judge and a federal appellate judge at the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, a staff attorney for over six years at the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and former general counsel to Oklahoma’s Consumer Credit Commission, I am adept at representing you in federal and state courts, at any level—administrative/agency, trial, and appellate. A litigator to my core, if you need someone to help you solve a dispute, let me know. I am also a trained and certified mediator, and am mindful that many times, the best solution for my client is a settlement, not a trial. If you are a lawyer who despises writing briefs or handling appeals, my extensive experience in legal research and writing, as well as in handling appeals and writing decisions for the Oklahoma Supreme Court while a staff lawyer, provides me a firm foundation to handle any brief, trial or appellate, your practice may demand. I would be happy to assist you.

            <br><br>Business law has been a part of the fabric of my practice for years. There are many facets to this—formation of entities such as LLCs, PLLCs, partnerships and corporations; contract drafting and analysis; assistance with business plans, compliance with applicable state and federal regulations, and securing the appropriate and mandated licenses for your business enterprise. Oklahoma City is an incredible incubator for entrepreneurs! Whether your interests are high tech, biotech, conventional small business, or Oklahoma’s medical cannabis industry, you may need a business lawyer and I would be happy to assist you.<br><br>

            My interest in oil and gas began in the mid-1980s, when it was just blossoming in Oklahoma. As a mineral owner myself, I have extensive experience in reviewing, negotiating, and evaluating leasing, drilling, and purchase contracts in this industry. If you are a mineral owner and want a professional to guide you through the process of leasing or selling your minerals, give me a call. As a result of 11 years of insurance coverage work for national property and casualty insurers, I also have reviewed and analyzed many joint operating agreements, commercial liability policies, and drilling agreements. If you have a need in this context, I would be happy to assist you.

            <br><br>I also prepare wills and trusts, and handle estate planning work for my clients. I would be remiss in not mentioning that for approximately eleven years I have, and still do, serve as insurance coverage counsel for several national property and casualty insurers in connection with my Of Counsel status at a boutique OKC firm. If you have a significant insurance claim and need assistance in pursuing it to obtain a fair and reasonable settlement with your insurance company, I am intimately familiar with insurance policies, their provisions and construction, and the manner in which insurance companies relate to, and treat their insureds. Or if your insurance company has made you a settlement offer and you just want someone who is experienced in negotiating such settlements to look at it and provide an opinion about whether it is fair and reasonable, just let me know.</p><br>
